# IOT_Assignment_2

          ------------------------------Scenario------------------------------

This is an IoT project which is about an automatic Car Share System by using Raspberry Pi.
This system is used to book, find and unlock and lock a car with connecting the data to Google Cloud IoT Platform (https://cloud.google.com/solutions/iot/) and also Raspberry Pi.
The system involves 2 Raspberry Pi by communicating to each other for unlocking and returning the cars.
1) Master Pi - Web-based system connected with your Raspberry Pi
2) Agent Pi - every car has its own Raspberry Pi that attached on it


          ------------------------------Important------------------------------ 
1. Raspberry Pi model 4 or 3 should be used.
2. You must use Python 3.* to complete the tasks. Older versions must not be used.
3. Make sure you have installed the environment packages that listed below to run the program.
4. Unit testing are the file's name start with "test".
5. Facial Recognition file name needs to be edit in a defined format which has listed below.
6. Agent Pi is using USB camera.


          ------------------------------Facial Recognition:------------------------------
1) Run the file capture.py to capture the images of your face - it will automatically save in /data/raw with the correct filename format.
2) Run the file training.py to train the recognition model with the captured images that are stored in /data/raw folder. After successfully training, the images will be automatically moved to /data/dataset
3) If you want to train with other images that is not captured by the Agent Pi.
images should be preferably jpg (the more different images per face the more accurate the model) - image label become the face id
4) images labels should follow the following example
  person with id = 1
  mary.1.1.jpg
  mary.1.2.jpg
  . 
  .  

**DO NOT DELETE raw and dataset folders.Only its content can be deleted
